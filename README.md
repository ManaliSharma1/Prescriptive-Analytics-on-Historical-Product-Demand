# Prescriptive Analytics on Historical Product Demand

This project applies **prescriptive analytics** techniques to optimize inventory management using historical product demand data. The goal is to determine the most cost-effective order quantity by minimizing total inventory costs while meeting demand.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle – Product Demand Forecasting  
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/felixzhao/productdemandforecasting  
- **Key Features:**
  - Product Code
  - Warehouse
  - Product Category
  - Date
  - Order Demand

## Objective
To optimize inventory decisions using:
- Linear Programming (LP)
- Integer Programming (IP)
- Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)

The models balance purchasing, holding, and shortage costs to find an optimal ordering strategy.

## Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Descriptive Analytics (Demand Trends)
- Prescriptive Analytics using Optimization Models
- Sensitivity Analysis to study demand changes
- Business Metrics: Cost, Revenue, and Profit

## Key Results
- Optimal order quantity closely matches average demand
- LP, IP, and MIP produce similar results
- MIP is the most realistic model as it includes fixed ordering cost
- Optimized ordering improves cost efficiency and profitability
  
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how prescriptive analytics converts historical demand data into actionable inventory decisions using optimization techniques.
